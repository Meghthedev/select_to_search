# Select to Search

## Circle to Search, but for linux

I have been using cts on my phone since quite a while and it has become quite a habbit to circle anything to search
but i missed that on my pc, hence this script

you can just git clone this repo, add the run script command as a shortcut, and then you have "select" to search

It uses flameshot and curl, install them :D

if any better approach, then do lemme know
